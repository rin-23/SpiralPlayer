If I 
Should stay 
I would only be in your way 
So I'll go 
But I know 
I'll think of you every step of 
the way
And I... 
Will always 
Love you, oohh 
Will always 
Love you 
You 
My darling you 
Mmm-mm
Bittersweet 
Memories 
That is all I'm taking with me 
So good-bye 
Please don't cry 
We both know I'm not what you 
You need
And I... 
Will always love you 
I... 
Will always love you 
You, ooh
I hope 
life treats you kind 
And I hope 
you have all you've dreamed of 
And I wish you joy 
and happiness 
But above all this 
I wish you love 
And I... 
Will always love you 
I... 
Will always love you 
I, I will always love 
You.... 
You 
Darling I love you 
I'll always 
I'll always 
Love 
You.. 
Oooh 
Ooohhh
